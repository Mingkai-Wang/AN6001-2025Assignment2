<p><strong><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1. The main differences between
traditional web applications and decentralized applications (dApps)</span></strong></p>

<p>Traditional web applications rely on centralized servers controlled by a
single entity, while decentralized applications (dApps) run on blockchain
networks, making them resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
While traditional applications use standard databases (such as MySQL) for data
storage, dApps store critical data on the blockchain for immutability. DApps
use smart contracts for back-end logic, eliminating intermediaries. While
traditional applications offer higher speed and availability, dApps improve
security and transparency at the cost of scalability. Users of dApps typically
interact with the application via encrypted wallets rather than traditional
login systems.</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2. How blockchain networks support
dApps and the role of smart contracts</span></strong></p>

<p>Blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Solana provide the decentralized
infrastructure for dApps by ensuring immutable, trustless execution. Smart
contracts (automatically executed programs stored on the blockchain) help
automate, enforce rules and eliminate middlemen. They handle everything from
financial transactions to governance. Ethereum's Solidity-based smart contracts
provide programmable logic for DeFi, NFTs and DAOs, while Solana offers faster
execution speeds and lower fees. These smart contracts run on decentralized
nodes, ensuring transparency and security. Blockchain networks use systems like
proof-of-stake to check and record transactions permanently. This stops any
unauthorized changes and builds trust in applications not controlled by a
single entity.</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3. Challenges in developing and
deploying dApps</span></strong></p>

<p>Developing and deploying dApps face challenges in security, scalability and
user experience. Security risks include smart contract vulnerabilities (e.g.,
reentrancy attacks, logic flaws) and vulnerabilities resulting from immutable
blockchain execution. Scalability is a major hurdle, as most blockchains have
limited transaction throughput, resulting in high fees and congestion. The user
experience suffers due to slow transaction confirmation times and complex
wallet integration. In addition, regulatory uncertainty, limited developer
tools, and the need for decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS, Arweave)
complicate dApp deployment. To mitigate these issues, continuous auditing,
layer-two solutions, and optimized contract logic are essential.</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>4. Ensuring data privacy and security
for dApps</span></strong></p>

<p>DApps must balance transparency and privacy. While blockchain transactions
are publicly accessible, technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP),
privacy-preserving smart contracts (e.g., Secret Network), and encrypted
off-chain storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) help protect sensitive data. User
authentication relies on encrypted wallets (e.g., MetaMask), reducing reliance
on centralized credentials. However, one can still trace transaction metadata.
Implementing privacy-focused protocols (e.g., Tornado Cash for transaction
mixing) or using privacy blockchains (e.g., Monero, Zcash) can enhance
anonymity. Multi-signature wallets, decentralized identity solutions (DIDs),
and strong key management strategies further enhance user security and privacy
in dApps.</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>5. Real-world use cases of dApps
across industries</span></strong></p>

<p>dApps are transforming various industries by enabling trustless,
decentralized operations. In finance (DeFi), Uniswap and Aave enable
peer-to-peer trading and lending without intermediaries. Gaming dApps (e.g.,
Axie Infinity) introduce game monetization models based on blockchain-based
assets. Supply chain solutions (e.g., VeChain) improve transparency by tracking
goods immutably. In social media, decentralized alternatives such as Lens
Protocol prevent censorship and data monopolies. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations) enable collective decision-making without a central authority.
Healthcare dApps protect patient records with encrypted access controls. As
dApps become more widespread, they will continue to disrupt traditional
business models by offering greater transparency, security and efficiency.</p>
